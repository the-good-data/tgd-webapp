                <h2>Who we are</h2>

                <p>We are The Good Data Cooperative Limited, an Industrial and Provident Society registered in England and Wales under registered number XXXX whose registered office is at Unit 1, 82 Clerkenwell Road, London EC1M 5RF.<
                <p>In this website we provide data management services once users have installed Our browser extension (&quot;Services&quot;). </p>
                <p>We have notified the Information Commissioner&#39;s Office and are registered on the Data Protection Register under registration number XXXX.</p>
                <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                <p>Our Privacy Policy develops the following guidelines:</p>
                <ol start="1">
                    <li><a class="inner-link" data-ref="#contract" href="#item-1">Our browser extension does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of Service Users or store any cookies.</a></li>
                    <li><a class="inner-link" data-ref="#contract" href="#item-2">Anonymous data will only be stored with your permission.</a></li>
                    <li><a class="inner-link" data-ref="#contract" href="#item-3">Anonymous data will only be traded with third parties if you provide an additional and limited permission to do so.</a></li>
                    <li><a class="inner-link" data-ref="#contract" href="#item-4">Only if you request to become a cooperative Member, we will have to store as minimum PII as possible.</a></li>
                    <li><a class="inner-link" data-ref="#contract" href="#item-5">We will always do our best effort to avoid unwanted access to your data by third parties.</a></li>
                    <li><a class="inner-link" data-ref="#contract" href="#item-6">We will provide you access to the data we have about yourself, as well as the possibility to correct it or remove it from our servers at any time without delay.</a></li>
                </ol>
                <ol start="1">
                    <li><h3 id="item-1">Our browser extension does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of Service Users or store any cookies.</h3>
                        <p>&ldquo;Personally identifiable information&rdquo; (PII) &nbsp;is data that can be used to identify a particular person. Aggregate or Anonymous data aren&rsquo;t considered PII. Service Users are those individuals that install our browser extension and enjoy any of our services, as described in our Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p>Unlike most websites, our site doesn&rsquo;t install any type of browser cookies or stores any IP data that could be used to identify our users. We will only keep the minimum of logs and debug information necessary to ensure that we can improve the service and resolve issues that may have occurred. These logs will be kept for a maximum of 15 days.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol start="2">
                    <li><h3 id="item-2">Anonymous data will be stored only with your permission.</h3>
                        <p>Being a data cooperative, we aim to gather Anonymous/non-PII data that you produce in order to help you enjoy the value of it. At this time, this data consists of behavioural and interest data such as browsing history and search queries.</p>
                        <p>This data will only be stored if you provide us with your permission. You will be able to enjoy our services regardless of your decision to let us store this data or not.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol start="3">
                    <li><h3 id="item-3">Anonymous data will only be traded with third parties if you provide an additional and limited permission to do so.</h3>
                        <p>In case we find a third party interested on your anonymized data, we will only give access to it provided that you have previously given us permission to do so. This permission will be limited to a certain and known type of data, for a limited time period and for a type of third party. This permission may contain as well certain terms limits (minimum benefit expected, etc). Data traded will not include PII data.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol start="4">
                    <li><h3 id="item-4">Only if you request to become a cooperative Member, we will store as minimum PII as possible. </h3>
                        <p>In case you request to become a cooperative Member, we will request as minimum PII as required by law in order to identify and register you as a Member. Once your request has been accepted, we will encrypt the link between your PII and your Service usage data with two-man rule techniques so only our Membership Committee will be able to deanonymise your usage data (ie. we will know that someone has visited certain website, but will not be able to know its personal details). Thats the reason why from then on we will address you by your username.</p>
                        <p>Only if you Terminate or you are Expulsed as a Member, this data will be de-encrypted by our Membership Committee from our files prior immediate deletion. Termination and Membership Expulsion events are described in the Company Rules and Secondary Rules.</p>
                        <p>Optionally, you may provide your email address. It will be used both for password recovery as well as to receive company communications. This is the only PII that for operative purposes cannot be encrypted, therefore we recommend you that if you decide to provide it, to use a non-traceable email address.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol start="5">
                    <li><h3 id="item-5">We will always do our best effort to avoid unwanted access to your data by third parties.</h3>
                        <p>We will always implement the most robust legal, procedural, physical and technical measures that are at our reach in order to ensure your anonymity and avoid unwanted access to your data by other individuals, corporations and administrations. Unwanted access refers to access to your data without your express permission.</p>
                        <p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure though. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You do so at your own risk.</p>
                        <p>If we should ever file for bankruptcy, or have any of our assets sold to or merged with another entity, data that we have about you will never be transferred, nor will be the browser extensions that we have available in the different app stores.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <ol start="6">
                    <li><h3 id="item-6">We will provide you access to the data we have about yourself, as well as the possibility to correct it or remove it from our servers at anytime without delay.</h3>
                        <p>In our website you will always have access to the data we have gathered, processed or inferred about yourself, as well as the possibility to download it or delete it from our servers at any time.</p>
                        <p>You may ask us to correct information you think is inaccurate by contacting us at info@thegooddata.org.</p>
                        <p>Data about terminated or expulsed members as well as from inactive users will be automatically deleted from our records with a delay no longer than one month. As inactive users we refer to individuals that have not used our services for 3 months or more.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

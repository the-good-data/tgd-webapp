                        <p>We believe that data is good for you provided you master it. Ownership helps you being considered a customer in front of companies, not a simple user or a product.</p>

                        <p>Our Mission is so challenging that the only way to make it happen is with the power of crowds. The collaboration of Customers and coders.</p>
                        <p>This is being done in a transparent, open way. You have access to all code and company info.</p>

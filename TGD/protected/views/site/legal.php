Aggregate or anonymous Service data are not considered PII. Service Users are those individuals that install our browser extension and enjoy any of our Services, as described in our Terms of Use.</p>

                                    <p>Being a data cooperative, we aim to gather the anonymous Service data that you produce in order to help you enjoy the value of it. At this time, this data consists of online behavioral and interest data, such as browsing history and search queries.</p>
                                    <p>This data will only be stored if you give us your permission to do so. You will be able to enjoy our Services regardless of your decision to let us store this data or not.</p>
                                    <p>Raw online behavioral data will be automatically deleted if older than three months. Estimated and aggregated behavioral and interest data may be kept for longer only if it remains valid and commercially valuable.</p>

                                    <p>In case we find a third party interested on your anonymous data, we will only provide access to it if you have previously given us permission to do so. This permission will be limited to a certain type of data, for a limited time period and for a type of third party. This permission may contain certain terms limits (minimum benefit expected, etc).

                                    <p>If you apply to become a cooperative Member, we will request the minimum PII required by law for identifying and registering you as a Member. Once you become a Member, we will encrypt the link between your PII and your Service data with two-man rule techniques. This means that we will know that someone has visited certain website, but will not be able to know his/her personal details. This is why we will from this point forward address you by your username.</p>
                                    <p>Only our Membership Committee will be able to de-anonymize your Service data if we are legally forced to do so, or if you terminate your Membership, or if you are expelled as a Member. In the latter two cases all your data will immediately be deleted after being de-encrypted.</p>
                                    <p>Only your email address will remain attached to your Service data. It will be used both for password recovery as well as to send you company announcements. This is the only PII that for operative purposes cannot be detached from your Service data; if you are worried about your anonymity, we recommend you to use a non-personally identifiable email address.</p>
                                    <p>We may use MailChimp to manage some of our email communications with cooperative Members. There is no third-party tracking present in messages that we send through MailChimp except for MailChimp’s own analytics, which may aggregate how many subscribers open a message or click the links within emails.

                                <p>This agreement (our secondary rules) sets out the commitment between The Good Data Cooperative Ltd. (“TheGoodData”) and you , its Members. These should be read in addition to our Company Principles and our Company Rules as an Industrial and Provident Society, Cooperative Consortia. Both are available on our website. TheGoodData is a learning organization that aims for an ongoing increase in collaboration with its Members; therefore, these rules will evolve over time through consultation with them.</p>

                                <p>TheGoodData is a cooperative of Customers that aim to help its Members to regain ownership over the data that they produce. This implies supporting them in identifying, gathering, producing, securing and/or processing the data that they directly or indirectly collaborate to generate, as well as supporting them to keep it private if they choose to do so, or trade it, or to set up services that trade it with corporations, administrations or other Customers in exchange for a financial benefit and/or any other tangible or intangible benefit.</p>

                                <p>By regaining data ownership, Customers will have more freedom of choice, more negotiation power and ultimately will ultimately be more satisfied and happier in their relationships with corporations.</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li value="6">TheGoodData is managed by a Board of Directors elected by its Members and which carries out day- to-day administration and planning on behalf of all Members.
                                        <ol type="a">
                                            <li>The Board is made up of between three and five Directors. We aim for the Board to be representative of the different Company Areas that ideally include users, coders and data experts.</li>

                                            <li>Directors may co-opt Members without them being elected at an Annual General Meeting. Co-opted Members will then have to stand for re-election at the Annual General meeting. At any one time no more than one third of Directors can be co-opted.</li>
                                            <li> The Annual General Meeting can elect the Board if there is at least 15% of Members Quorum. The quorum should consider physical and electronic presence, and advanced votes.</li>
                                            <li>Directors may be rewarded for their work. Reward schemes and levels have to be approved at the Annual General Meeting by the majority of Members.</li>

                                <li value="8">TheGoodData is divided into four major Areas of responsibility: Corporate (strategy, finance, legal &amp; brand), Product (development of different projects and operations), Data (harvesting, securing, processing and trading) and People (users, members, collaborators and social impact). Each of these Areas will be lead by a Director. The major decisions of each Area will be raised to the Board of Directors for approval. </li>
                                <li>Directors may decide to appoint an Area Subcommittee to provide support for the company’s day-to-day duties. Subcommittees are made-up of three people and shall comprise one Director or a Director elected Officer and two other Members for a duration of one year. At least two of these individuals should participate in major decisions.</li>
                                <li>The proceedings of Subcommittee meetings are to be reported to the Board of Directors. Subcommittee meetings may make decisions on affairs relating to the work of the particular Area, but issues of direct importance to the TheGoodData as a whole should be taken, as a proposal or item for discussion, to the Board of Directors. The Directors may open for discussion decisions made at Subcommittee meetings if it is deemed that they are of direct importance to the TheGoodData as a whole.</li>
                                <li>The Membership Subcommittee will be in charge, among other duties. of accepting Membership applications, dealing with Member claims, evaluating Member’s expulsion cases, or disclosing any Member’s data if requested by authorities.

                                        <li> If the Board considers that the volume of work, or language diversity, so justifies, they are empowered to establish more than one Membership Subcommittee.</li>
                                        <li>Membership applications and claims can be dealt by one single (1) Subcommittee Member.</li> 
                                        <li> In case of unresolved claims, the Member should raise the matter with the designated Board Member. If the matter is not resolved informally, the Member should write to the Board so that the matter can be raised at the next Board meeting.</li>
                                        <li> Member expulsion decisions will only be made after inviting the Member to submit written comments about the case.</li>
                                        <li> Disclosure to Authorities of Membership Data can only be done upon approval of the majority of Subcommittee Members. The Subcommittee will only attend to requests from legitimate authorities.</li>
                                        <li>Subcommittee Members shall, prior to acceptance of their duties, read and accept TheGoodData’s Privacy Policy and commit to enforce it at all times.</li>

                                <li>Subcommittees for the other Areas can be appointed at any time by the Area Director who will determine their Membership.</li>
                                <li>Ad hoc working &ldquo;Nodes&rdquo; may be appointed by the Board of Directors at any time to deal with cross-area projects like the development of a new service or business line.</li>

                                <li>Decisions are to be made by a majority.</li>
                                <li> Volunteers, and any such persons that the Members of the meeting wish to invite, in an advisory or observational role, may attend meetings.

Sharing criteria will be decided by the Product Area Director or Product Subcommittee, and will consider the level of effort (ie. lines of code), the quality of the output and the strategic importance of the development.</li>
                                <li>Our Company Rules allow us to distribute surplus to Members as dividends; however we have chosen at present not to exercise this option, since we seek to strengthen the long-term viability of our organisation and further our social impact.</li>

                                    <p>&ldquo;Personally identifiable information&rdquo; (PII) &nbsp;is data that can be used to identify a particular person. Aggregate or Anonymous data aren&rsquo;t considered PII. Service Users are those individuals that install our browser extension and enjoy any of our Services, as described in our Terms of Use.</p>
                                    <p>Unlike most websites, our site doesn&rsquo;t install any type of browser cookies or stores any IP data that could be used to identify our users. We will only keep the minimum of logs and debug information necessary to ensure that we can improve the Service and resolve issues that may have occurred. These logs will be kept for a maximum of 15 days.</p>

                                    <p>Being a data cooperative, we aim to gather Anonymous Service data that you produce in order to help you enjoy the value of it. At this time, this data consists of online behavioural and interest data such as browsing history and search queries.</p>
                                    <p>This data will only be stored if you provide us with your permission. You will be able to enjoy our Services regardless of your decision to let us store this data or not.</p>
                                    <p>Raw online behavioural data will be automatically deleted if older than 3 months. Estimated and aggregated behavioural and interest data may be kept for longer only if it remains valid and commercially valuable.</p>

                                    <p>In case we find a third party interested on your Anonymous data, we will only give access to it provided that you have previously given us permission to do so. This permission will be limited to a certain type of data, for a limited time period and for a type of third party. This permission may contain as well certain terms limits (minimum benefit expected, etc). Data traded will not include PII data.</p>

                                    <p>In case you apply to become a cooperative Member, we will request as minimum PII as required by law in order to identify and register you as a Member. Once you become a Member, we will encrypt the link between your PII and your Service data with two-man rule techniques. That means that we will know that someone has visited certain website, but will not be able to know its personal details. That is the reason why from then on we will address you by your username.</p>
                                    <p>Only our Membership Committee will be able to deanonymise your Service data if we are legally forced or if you terminate your Membership or you are expulsed as a Member. On these two last cases all your data will be immediately deleted after de-encrypted.</p>
                                    <p>Only email will remain attached to your Service data. It will be used both for password recovery as well as to send you company announcements. This is the only PII that for operative purposes cannot be detached from your Service data, so if you are worried about your anonymity, we recommend you to use a non personally identifiable email address.</p>
                                    <p>We may use MailChimp to manage some of our email communications with cooperative Members. There’s no third-party tracking in messages we send through MailChimp besides MailChimp’s own analytics, which may aggregate how many subscribers open a message or click the links inside. MailChimp’s privacy policy is available at http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy.</p>

                                <p>This agreement (our secondary rules) sets out the commitment between The Good Data Cooperative Ltd (&ldquo;TheGoodData&rdquo;) and you &ndash; the Members. These should be read in addition to our Company Principles and our Company Rules as an Industrial and Provident Society, Cooperative Consortia. Both are available on our website. TheGoodData is a learning organisation and aims for an ongoing increase in collaboration of Members and therefore these rules will evolve over time through consultation with them.</p>

                                <p>TheGoodData is a cooperative of Customers that aim to help its Members to regain ownership over the data that they produce. That implies supporting them identifying, gathering, producing, securing and/or processing the data that they directly or indirectly collaborate to generate, as well as supporting them keeping it private if they want, or trading with it or setting up services that trade with it in front of Corporations, Administrations or other Customers in exchange of a financial benefit and/or any other tangible or intangible benefit.</p>

                                <p>By regaining data ownership, Customers will have more freedom of choice, more negotiation power and ultimately will be more satisfied and happier in their relationships with Corporations.</p>

Each of the Areas will be lead by a Director. Major decisions of each Area will be raised to the Board of Directors for approval. </li>
                                <li>Directors may decide to appoint an Area Subcommittee to provide support on its day-to-day duties. Subcommittees are made-up of 3 people and shall comprise one Director or Director elected Officer and two other Members for a duration of 1 year. At least 2 of them should participate of major decisions.</li>
                                <li>The proceedings of Subcommittee meetings are to be reported to the Board of Directors. Subcommittee meetings may make decisions on affairs relating to the work of the Area, but issues of direct importance to the TheGoodData as a whole should be taken, as a proposal or item for discussion, to the Board of Directors. The Directors may open for discussion decisions made at Subcommittee meetings if it is deemed that they are of direct importance to the TheGoodData as a whole.</li>
                                <li>The Membership Subcommittee will be in charge among other duties of accepting Membership applications, as well as of dealing with Member claims, evaluating Member&rsquo;s expulsion cases or disclosing any Member&rsquo;s data if requested by Authorities.

                                        <li>In case of unresolved claims then the Member should raise the matter with the designated Board Member. If the matter is not resolved informally then the Member should write to the Board so that the matter can be raised at the next Board meeting.</li>
                                        <li>Member expulsion decisions will only be made after inviting the Member for written comments about the case.</li>
                                        <li>Disclosure to Authorities of Membership Data can only be done upon approval of the majority of Subcommittee Members. Subcommittee will only attend requests of legitimate UK and European authorities.</li>

                                <li>Ad hoc working &ldquo;Nodes&rdquo; may be appointed by the Board of Directors at any time to deal with cross-area projects like the development of a new service or business line.</li>

                                <li>Our Company Rules allow us to distribute surplus to Members as dividends, but we have chosen at present not to exercise this option, since we seek to strengthen the long-term viability of our organisation and further our social impact.</li>

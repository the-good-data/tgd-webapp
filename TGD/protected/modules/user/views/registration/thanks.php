                    <p>As you can imagine, becoming a company owner is a bit trickier than registering to a service!</p>
                    <p>We just need to check the details that you have submitted and, if everything looks ok, we will send you an email inviting you to become a member. We will do our best to do it in one working day.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime you can keep on using TheGoodData extension.</p>
                    <p>Should you have any question about your application, please contact <a href="mailto:members@thegooddata.org">members@thegooddata.org</a></p>
